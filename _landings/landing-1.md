background: |
    Following the success of the previous editions of the BioHackathon Europe ([2018](https://2018.biohackathon-europe.org/), [2019](https://2019.biohackathon-europe.org/) and [2020](https://2020.biohackathon-europe.org/)) organised by ELIXIR Europe, and building on the BioHackathons organised by National Bioscience Database Center ([NBDC](https://biosciencedbc.jp/?lng=en)) and Database Center for Life Science ([DBCLS](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html)), we are planning to run BioHackathon Europe 2021 in Barcelona 8-12 November 2021. We hope to build on our success and encourage more ELIXIR and non-ELIXIR participants to take part, as well as attract further industry engagement.

scope: |
    BioHackathon activities are driven by practical sessions where people gather, discuss, and implement ideas/projects during intensive and productive coding sessions. The topics will be aligned to challenges proposed by [ELIXIR Platforms](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms) (Data, Tools, Compute, Interoperability and Training), [ELIXIR Communities](https://elixir-europe.org/communities) (Human Data, Rare Diseases, Marine Metagenomics, Plant Science, Metabolomics and Proteomics), and/or [Focus Groups](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups) (e.g. Biodiversity, Cancer Data, Health Data, Machine Learning), and a set of common challenges proposed by the sister [BioHackathon](http://www.biohackathon.org) organised in Japan.
