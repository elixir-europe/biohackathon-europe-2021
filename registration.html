        <h2>Participant registration</h2>
<p>Registration will open in June 2021. </p>
        <!-- <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/biohackathon-europe-2020-registration-104117179286" target="_blank" class="button fit special">Register here!</a>-->

        <h2>Going hybrid</h2>
        <p>This year we are planning to bring you the BioHackathon face-to-face, with remote access available i.e. hybrid attendance. We prefer face-to-face participation, but if the circumstances do not allow it then remote access will be available. Remote access will be organised by each project leader. We provide a live stream of reporting sessions.</p>

<p>We believe the new format will allow everyone to participate in the BioHackathon and deliver tangible outcomes from the selected projects.</p>

<p>BioHackathon Europe has limited space for face-to-face participation. The registration is based on a first-come, first-served basis. </p>
