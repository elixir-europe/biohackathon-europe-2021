        <h1>Participant registration</h1>

        <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/biohackathon-europe-2020-registration-104117179286" target="_blank" class="button fit special">Register here!</a>

        <h2>Going virtual</h2>
        <p>This year, we bring you the BioHackathon in a virtual fashion. This 9-13 November, we will put online platforms to the test to bring you a fun and productive event — we will be using <a href="https://remo.co/">Remo</a> & SLACK!</p>
        <p>We believe the new format will allow everyone to participate in the BioHackathon and deliver tangible outcomes from the selected projects.</p>
        <p>While the BioHackathon is going virtual, seats are limited and registration is based on a first-come, first-served basis. Don’t miss your chance to attend this year and register before 18 September 2020.</p>
