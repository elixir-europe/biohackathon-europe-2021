  - abstract: One of the recurring questions when it comes to BioHackathons is how to
      measure their impact. In order to do so, we first need to understand the outcomes
      from a BioHackathon. Some possible outcomes are software, publications and collaborations.
      Such outcomes could be analyzed from activity post-hackathon on GitHub repositories
      as well as publications generated out of BioHackathon topics. For the particular
      case of the BioHackathon-Europe, which has been running only for two years now,
      we propose to focus on GitHub activity post-BioHackathon. We want to learn about
      what happens with the ...

      data stewards and researchers in building data management plans together. DSW
      is being actively developed and new features are regularly included according

  - abstract: In the last few decades we have seen the surfacing and spreading of many
      novel pathogenic viruses. Some were mutations of the traditional influenza viruses,
      and some were viruses that crossed the animal-human divide and became a threat
      to human lives. An example of the former is the influenza A (H1N1) virus that
      caused a pandemic in 2009 [1], while an example of the latter are highly pathogenic
      avian influenza A(H7N9), A(H5N1), and A(H5N6), low pathogenic avian influenza
      A(H7N2), swine influenza A(H1N2)v and A(H3N2) [2]. In he above cases, when a novel

  - abstract: The curation of biological information faces lots of challenges today.
      The constant refactoring of ontologies, nomenclature and identifiers, as well
      as the discovery of new information, makes the life of knowledge curators difficult,
      especially in the highly diverse biology domain. For example, expert curators
      who use software tools to help them with the annotation process, might come across
      a new feature or functionality that does not exist within an ontology or data
      resource that their annotation tool connects to. Similar difficulties are faced
      by biologists who want to quickly curate ...

  - abstract: BioHackrXiv is the publishing platform for Biohackathons. For this hackathon
      we aim to improve the editorial/submission process by automating generation of
      publications and creating useful metadata in the form of RDF which gets exposed
      through a SPARQL end point. In addition we would like to link up Jupyter and R
      markdown notebooks so authors can publish live code with their static papers.

      and reproducible way to benchmark a set of tools through software containerization.
      Here we will use Copy Number Variation detection tools as a use-case. Copy Number
      Variations are mutational events vital for evolution and they play an important
      role in diseases. Even if CNVs are the most prevalent genetic mutation type, identifying
      and interpreting them is still a major challenge. The ELIXIR human Copy Number

      including several hundred small single-disease-focused registries being run by
      non-technical experts. Notably, this is among the most sensitive of all data,

      \ Machine learning in high-variability areas, such as food and nutrition, is a\
      \ very complex problem. Data mining with machine learning is an urgency for the\
      \ study of dietary intolerance and allergies, especially when accurate labeling\
      \ is required by laws. Large-scale databasing also introduces demands for structuring\
      \ information of manufacturer\u2019s data. Lack of semantic implementation to\
      \ structure food data is a resolvable challenge that can be overcome by using\
      \ existing technologies equipped with knowledge ..."

    title: 'Panoptes: monitor computational workflows in real time'
  - abstract: The exponential growth of high throughput devices, such as next generation
      sequencing or electron microscopy is generating an unprecedent amount of raw data
      that needs to be processed, analysed and exploited. The challenge lies in the
      capability to turn the big data produced by the life sciences workflows into actionable
      insights. How to do that as quickly as possible while ensuring that all data remains
      safe and secure? BullSequana Edge has been designed to meet these challenges,
      delivering powerful AI inference and streaming analytics capabilities at the edge.

  - abstract: Services Bundles are a new mechanism to identify how ELIXIR platforms
      and communities are able to address specific user needs. In the context of the
      Service Bundles pilots around Rare Disease we propose a project aimed to complete
      the offer of the Service Bundles identified so far. The Project will have a dual
      aspect of creation of containers of the tools not yet available in the BioContainers
      registry and defining the workflows targeting the use cases driving the Service
      Bundles. On the BioContainer front we plan to contribute to the recipes in BioConda
      and take advantage of the ELIXIR ...
