"""
Script used to generate a folder and README file for each project accepted
for BioHackathon Europe (https://biohackathon-europe.org/). The script will also
generate a YAML file of the projects.

INPUT: a CSV file from the event management software (EventBrite, EasyChair).
The CSV file will contain the projects submitted for the BioHackathon.
The expected fields in this file are: #, EventBrite, Authors, Title, Leads for Project,
Expected outcomes, Expected participants, Nominated participant,
Number of days for project, Topics, Time, Decision, Keywords, Abstract. These
fields seem to vary from year to year, so the script may need to be tweaked accordingly.

OUTPUT: (1) a folder for each project, containing a README file with a summary of
the project (e.g. https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2021);
(2) a YAML file containing the projects (e.g. https://github.com/elixir-europe/
biohackathon-europe-2021/blob/master/scripts/projects.yml). This is
used on the BioHackathon website to generate the Projects page (projects.html).

CONTACTS: webmaster@elixir-europe.org (for the script), jen.harrow@elixir-europe.org
(for the CSV file)
