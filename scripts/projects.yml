- abstract: 'BioHackrXiv is a low-threshold citable publishing platform for

    biohackathon projects which is (now) listed on PMC.

    https://biohackrxiv.org/ is a scholarly publication service for

    biohackathons and codefests where papers are generated from markdown

    templates where the header is a YAML/JSON record that includes the

    title, authors, affiliations and tags. As part of the Elixir

    Biohackathon 2020 we created a metadata resource for BioHackrXiv, a

    prepublishing service hosted on OSF.io that allows for citable

    Biohackathon reports using unique identifiers. We added metadata in RDF with information
    on the biohackathons, papers, repositories, contributors and tags. This

    metadata can be expanded and that can easily be done by modifying the

    source code in the online github repository. During the ELIXIR

    biohackathon 2021 we''ll add functionality building on the work we did

    at the 2020 online ELIXIR biohackathon.'

  title: Improve BioHackrXiv
- abstract: We will build a usable proof-of-concept tool that indicates what data
    is available for the federation of multiple datatypes (e.g. multi-omic data) in
    population-scale analyses. This will differ from existing efforts insofar as not
    all input data must be sensu strictu fair. To achieve this goal, we will work
    with three example repositories; UKBioBank (scrambled data), Federated EGA (only
    that available in surface level API) and refine.bio. We will do a light level
    of NLP/Metadata Harmonization to establish disease pairing and then build a POC
    UI that will notify investigators of technical and regulatory requirements to
    proceed with the experiment (i.e. where they need to bring particular tools, and
    which DACs they need to apply to for the raw data, if relevant). We will also
    implement flexible variant annotation to extend our analysis based on existing
    knowledge bases. Our stretch goal will be to integrate these analyses with our
    current work (partially in other biohackathons) related to both graph genomes
    and clinical reporting.

    \ the ELIXIR Plant Sciences Community sees opportunities to contribute to tasks\
    \ T1 (data standards development and dissemination), T2 (data collection), T4\
    \ (data integration), and T7 (tools and workflows) of its roadmap [https://doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1118482.1]\
    \ through the following activities.\nThe MIAPPE standard [https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16544]\
    \ provides a biologist-friendly guide to capture phenotyping data in the best\
    \ reusable way and expose it in the standard ISA format. To feature a RDM process\
    \ from data acquisition to data integration, we propose to work on two aspects\
    \ here.\n\nThe first aspect enables MIAPPE 1.1 in ISA4J library to generate compliant\
    \ ISA formatted data files [ https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27188.1 ],\
    \ hence allowing plant scientists to store phenotyping metadata in a reusable\
    \ way. The software will be designed as a library for developers to use in their\
    \ data publishing workflows, and will include a graphical and/or command line\
    \ interface as time permits. The results can be integrated in a ready-to-use data\
    \ warehouse, relying on Zendro(https://zendro-dev.github.io). It would expose\
    \ an intuitive web interface backed by a GraphQL API, linking data processing\
    \ scripts to the knowledge hub and be capable of seamlessly connecting to other\
    \ instances from a data cloud.\n\nThe second aspect enables data integration through\
    \ Knowledge Graphs (KG) based tools and models for plant omics (e.g., ISA, MIAPPE,\
    \ BrAPI, Knetminer) to be aligned with other ontologies/models (e.g., Bioschemas,\
    \ Dublin Core, or BioLink). An effort will be made to develop and extend shared\

    project is to increase bioinformatics and core data analysis skills in the field
    of life sciences across Europe.

    A pilot effort in 2019, started during Biohackathon in 2018, developed Hybrid
    Training: broadcast of a single instructor to learners in distributed classrooms
    with on-site helpers. This significantly improved the scalability and decreased
    the environmental impact of having instructors travel around Europe. With COVID-19
    pandemic, hybrid and/or fully virtual training events have become the norm. To
    support this teaching format, training materials must be adapted, and instructors
    need to be trained.

    Main focus of the BioHackathon project will be to discuss, and create draft for
    training modules on microbial analysis, machine-learning, and Train-the-Trainer
    (TtT), specifically tailored to fit a remote/hybrid training format. Specifically,

    \ that biodiversity data are full of errors. Can we use the idiosyncraticities\
    \ of people\u2019s data to find these errors and correct them? During the Biohackathon\
    \ 2021 we will use people\u2019s biodiversity observation data and connect those\
    \ data to their biographies and other research outputs through Wikidata. We will\
    \ particularly characterize their spatial patterns of observing with the intention\
    \ to identify outliers. For example, we can identify errors where a person is\
    \ purported to be in two places at the same time. We can further extend this by\
    \ calculating the properties of a person\u2019s observing patterns. People observe\
    \ in very different ways depending on the target species, the landscape, and their\
    \ own preferences and abilities. Improved models of the data collection process\

- abstract: 'Nightingale is a set of open-source, reusable, composable, and extendable
    components to visualise biological data and implemented following web standards.
    Their main focus is visualising biological sequences information.


    Nightingale was born out of the visualisation needs of UniProt, InterPro, and
    PDBe (all being ELIXIR Core Data Resources) and expanded to accommodate the requirements
    of other resources such as Open Targets. The Biohackathon would provide a fertile
    ground to collect new use cases, and would allow us to improve the definition
    of our component APIs adhering to ubiquitous web standards so they can be used
    by the broader community.


    While the aim of the Nightingale project is to cover the data visualisation aspect,
    the definition of common standards throughout the life science ecosystem is already
    a task that the BioSchemas community is undertaking. Therefore, a current Nightingale
    goal is to make this set of components consume data marked up with the Protein
    profile of BioSchemas using existing scrappers like BMUSE.

    The open source nature of the project makes it challenging to find common time
    and space for growth, but the Biohackathon has previously provided that space
    for Nightingale and we hope to return in 2021 and improve Nightingale even further.'

- abstract: 'Linking molecular data to taxonomic names and their extensive taxonomic
    treatments represents a fundamental component in biodiversity assessment. Voucher
    specimens for sequenced data can be the key nodes to make these connections. During
    Biohackathon 2020, several projects investigated how sequence (meta)data could
    be retrieved from ENA and connected to taxonomic treatment or specimen databases
    like TreatmentBank and GBIF.


    With this proposal, we aim to link more voucher specimens to sequences by applying
    machine learning techniques to specimen images, retrieving sequencing metadata
    physically on the specimen that can facilitate and maximize the linking process.
    We will then employ these metadata to improve the ENA linking process, allowing

    to compare ENA, GBIF, and TB geographical data related to specific taxa and return
    the results in an interactive data exploration dashboard. The improvements will
    also address the gap-filling of gene names embedded in scientific papers relative

  title: Handling Knowledge graphs subsets
- abstract: 'With 20.000+ entries, bio.tools is a major registry of computational
    tools in the life sciences. In this BioHackathon project we will address two urgent
    needs of the platform:


    1. Slicing the bio.tools content through specialisation and categorisation, to
    improve exposure to communities and to present useful content for the users. The
    main challenge is to summarise relevant information from the wealth of annotation
    categories in bio.tools and metrics from external sources. Therefore we aim to
    enrich tools, communities and collections with statistics and metrics that summarise
    functionality, impact and annotation quality. These metrics and statistics are
    valuable resources for tool-building communities, scientific domains, individual
    scientific tool repositories and groups specialising in technical features. With
    that information, we can identify, calculate and integrate metrics relevant for
    the bio.tools registry. In addition we will devise a mock-up / alpha version summary
    stats page within bio.tools.


    2. Improving the quality of functional tool annotations, to enable automated composition
    of individual tools into multi-step computational pipelines or workflows. Currently,
    tool annotations are often incomplete or imprecise, hampering plug&play workflow
    composition. We will develop a protocol for improving functional tool annotations
    in bio.tools. It will be based on 1) selecting reference workflows from workflow
    repositories and literature, 2) trying to recreate them using bio.tools and the
    Automated Pipeline Explorer, 3) comparing automatically created and reference
    workflows, and 4) if necessary revising the tool annotations until recreation
    succeeds. Workshop participants will perform this process and concurrently develop
    the tooling and documentation to enable its application to additional workflows

  title: Making bio.tools Fit for Workflows
- abstract: 'Through the past BioHackathons, we collaborate with multiple groups from
    Elixir nodes to improve our Workflow Execution Service (WES) called Sapporo. The
    Sapporo consists of two components: sapporo-service, a standard implementation
    of the GA4GH WES API standard, and sapporo-web, a web application for managing
    runs on WES services. The Sapporo components are available on GitHub and have
    made a major update recently. In this hackathon, we would like to ask participants
    to have discussions and help for each layer of Sapporo: (1) sapporo-web, (2) sapporo-service,
    (3) workflow platform running inside the sapporo-service. For (1) sapporo-web,
    we would like to perform the compatibility testing of sapporo-web for the other
    WES implementations. For (2) sapporo-service, we would like to develop the conformance
    test and the loading test of WES. We also would like to implement the authentication
    layer for sapporo-server, ensuring the GA4GH passport standard. For (3) workflow
    layer, we would like to import the existing tool registries such as nf-core, workflowhub.eu,
    and Common Workflow Library. We also would like to investigate the strategies
    for CI of workflow using WES. Through this hackathon, we hope to improve the interoperability

- abstract: 'With the fast Increasing volumes of dataset being generated, routines
    for searching and discovering datasets are becoming more and more important and
    essential components for open science and efficient reuse of data.


    Although different paradigms exist to encourage dataset sharing and searching,
    for example FAIR Data Point and Google Dataset Search, it is still by far not
    as advanced as document search, particularly considering the lack of semantics
    during search and poor ranking due to very limited clues for ranking in the metadata.


    To address the challenge of enabling more effective ranking, we propose developing
    a ranking algorithm to help users more easily find the most relevant dataset to
    their query. We plan to implement and exercise this algorithm on a FAIR Data Point

    learning to biomedical ontologies. The methods can be broadly categorized into
    three groups: (1) graph-based methods that transform ontologies into graphs and
    apply graph-based machine learning methods; (2) syntactic methods which learn
    from axioms and textual information in the ontologies; (3) semantic methods which
    learn from OWL semantics of the ontologies directly. A number of ontology-based
    machine learning methods have been reviewed and evaluated in a recent paper (https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa199/5922325).

    Representation of structural variations (SVs) is one of the urgent issues for

    - Set of schemas describing the covered data. (Prepared during the hackathon,
    expanded over next years via Wikidata community)


    - We expect to create the starting points for new bots at the event. The implementation
    then relies on the Wikidata protocols, including acceptance of new proposals that
    might be required. We expect bots to be fully integrated after a few months.


    - New data contributions either done manually or through bots, such as missing
    Ensembl genes, handling versioning of genome assemblies, Complex Portal, BgeeDB,
    Clinvar entities. (Done during the hackathon as part of a continuous effort)


    - One or more PathVisio plugins for pathway curation using Wikidata.'

  title: Connecting ELIXIR-related open data on Wikidata via WikiProject ELIXIR
- abstract: In the collaborative framework between the Vertebrate Genomes Project
    (VGP), the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) and the Galaxy community, we
    will bring together genome assembly experts to test existing pipelines and develop
    new assembly approaches for different different organisms representing the world
    living diversity such as vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi. The goal is
    to generate guidelines for the optimal application of assembly pipelines for the
    scientific community and to make such pipelines accessible and reusable to a large
    number of users in Europe, hence the use of Galaxy framework. We will also develop
    training material and dedicated tutorials, by taking advantage of the lessons
    learned from the VGP, currently one of the most advanced groups of sequencing
    and assembly experts. The outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated via ERGA
    and VGP networks, through e.g. a webinar describing the content and usage of the
    workflows.

    for specific CNV analyses using containerised tools. CNVs are frequent mutational
    events in a spectrum of disorders and for any ELIXIR community/focus group working
    with human data.


    This proposal builds up on the efforts of the successful Biohackathon 2020 where
    a number of CNV detection tools have been containerised and wrapped for use in
    Galaxy. The proposal objectives are aligned with the ELIXIR 2021-2023 Implementation
    studies that involve hCNV and Galaxy communities. In particular during the Biohackathon
    2021 we aim to develop a Galaxy training network tutorial (https://training.galaxyproject.org)
    that will cover: development and submission of Galaxy CNVs analysis workflows
    to WorkflowHub(https://workflowhub.eu) as well as recording/benchmarking outputs
    of the hCNV analysis using Galaxy platform to OpenBench (https://openebench.bsc.es)'

  title: Galaxy training resources for CNVs detection software
- abstract: 'The design of AI systems for health is a grand achievement of science
    and technology of our times. Nevertheless, such systems learn to perform specific
    tasks by processing extensive amounts of data that is produced and stored in large
    biomedical repositories. The quality and content of this data have an immense
    impact on what and how AI learns. If the data contains biases, such as skewed
    representation of certain categories or missing information, the application of
    AI can lead to discriminatory outcomes and propagate them into society, as we
    recently pointed out (Cirillo et al. NPJ Digit Med. 2020 doi:10.1038/s41746-020-0288-5).

    The aim of our project is to determine the extent of biases in available demographic
    categories (sex, age, race) in ELIXIR biomedical data repositories, which are
    largely used in the community to train AI systems. We aim to quantify bias and
    provide recommendations on how to properly use the data to develop fair and trustworthy
    AI, including solutions and best practices.

    We have recently collected endorsement and support regarding this project from
    representatives of several ELIXIR platforms, communities and focus groups, namely
    Data platform, Human Data Communities, Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion group, Impact

  title: 'FAIRX: Quantitative bias assessment in ELIXIR biomedical data resources'
- abstract: 'The COVID-19 crisis demonstrates a critical requirement for rapid and
    efficient sharing of data to facilitate the global response to this and future
    pandemics. We can address this challenge by making viral genomic and patient phenomic
    data FAIR, and formalising it to permit seamless data integration for analysis.

    Phenopackets is a standard file format for sharing phenotypic information that
    facilitates communication within the research and clinical genomics communities.
    The OMOP model allows for large-scale analysis of distributed data to generate
    evidence for research that promotes better health decisions and better care. This
    gathered data is used by epidemiologists to monitor the infection, model it and
    make outbreak analysis and predictions to evaluate policy interventions. To harness
    machine-learning and AI approaches to discover meaningful patterns in epidemic
    outbreaks, we need to ensure that data are FAIR. To leverage data for federated
    learning/analytics, datasets can be discovered in FAIR Data Points; FAIR data
    repositories that publish human- and machine-readable metadata for data resources.
    This project aims to enhance interoperability between health and research data
    by mapping Phenopackets and OMOP and representing COVID-19 metadata using the
    FAIR principles to enable discovery, integration and analysis of genotypic and
    phenotypic data.'

- abstract: 'Computational pipelines have become ubiquitous in bioinformatics, with
    an increasing need for sharing them among researchers in portable formats like
    the Common Workflow Language (CWL).


    Galaxy has been involved in the development of the CWL standard from the start,

    and native support for CWL in Galaxy has been developed in a fork of the Galaxy
    codebase created by John Chilton.


    The first three European BioHackathons allowed several different contributors
    to work together on this project and discuss with the wider communities. This
    resulted in major progress in the CWL support in Galaxy, and in large portions
    of the CWL branch of Galaxy making their way into the core repository.


    In particular, an initial Galaxy implementation of a major feature of the v1.2
    version of the CWL specification was developed during the 2020 BioHackathon Europe:
    conditional execution of a workflow step. We plan to finish this work and merge
    the pull request ( https://github.com/common-workflow-language/galaxy/pull/123
    ) in the Galaxy fork.


    Other goals for the 2021 BioHackathon will be to fix the remaining required CWL
    1.2 conformance tests, work on the other open issues ( tracked at https://github.com/common-workflow-language/galaxy/issues
    ), and continue the merge of the separate CWL branch into the upstream Galaxy
